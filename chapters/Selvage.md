# Serverless computing

James Selvage

It was in 2016 at a summit in London that I first heard the “serverless” phrase and I was both confused and intrigued. It was a few talks in when one of the presenters said, “of course there are servers …” Phew that sounds more understandable.

So what is serverless computing? Of course there are servers, but you do stuff without managing them. The major cloud service providers offer serverless computing:
* Amazon Web Services - Lambda functions
* Google - Cloud functions
* Microsoft - Azure functions
* IBM - OpenWhisk

The one that I am most familiar with is Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda. Let’s look at an AWS provided example:
> “New function using blueprint s3-get-object-python”

Here’s the Python 2.7 Lambda function:

```python
    from __future__ import print_function
    import json
    import urllib
    import boto3
    print('Loading function')
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        print("Received event: " + json.dumps(event, indent=2))
        # Get the object from the event and show its content type
        bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
        key = urllib.unquote_plus(event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key'].encode('utf8'))
        try:
           response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
           print("CONTENT TYPE: " + response['ContentType'])
           return response['ContentType']
        except Exception as e:
           print(e)
           print('Error getting object {} from bucket {}. Make sure they exist and your bucket is in the same region as this         function.'.format(key, bucket))
           raise e
```
               
Once this Lambda function is created in your AWS Account you can link it to a trigger, which for this function is an S3 bucket (storage in the cloud) that is going to be populated with different files. Each time a file is put in the bucket:
* event triggers (input) 
* lambda function starts (server starts) 
* content type is printed (output)
* function ends (server stops)

No files added = no servers running, 1 file added = 1 server starts, runs & stops, n files added = n servers start, run & stop. That’s serverless... flexible computing.

It is a different way of developing applications and it requires a different way of thinking. By joining together multiple functions, you can create an Application Programming Interface (API). At Osokey, we’ve recently created an API for extracting meta data, viewing and processing SEG Y files. Each function is limited to a specific task, e.g. read the EBCDIC header from a SEG Y file, and each function is configured with different memory to meet its specific requirements. Multiple APIs can be joined together, e.g. a horizon-viewing API can be joined with the SEG Y viewing API. These APIs are callable by third parties, run on demand and are scaleable.

A complete platform for geosciences could be built by creating further APIs. How about an API for?
* Well log QC
* Rock physics
* Seismic attributes
* Full waveform inversion
* ...

At the same summit I also heard Conway’s Law, “Organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations”. Melvin Conway was not trying to be humorous, but have a think about the organisation that you work in and the systems that have been designed. 

Communication structures inside organisations are changing, but outside of work we have almost all adopted cloud-based solutions. Slack, Facebook, Google Services, WhatsApp, ... have all become hugely popular because they provide instant access from wherever we are. We don't need to have physical photo albums, video libraries or music collections anymore. This transition has happened without us really noticing and many of the tools integrate seamlessly into our lives. Why not the same for the data we use in our work?

In our industry when we are so dependent on external circumstances - licensing rounds, the price of oil, availability of farm-ins, ... would it not be better to vary our working practice according to the work that is actually required? Cloud services, like serverless computing, could provide the flexible platform for this, but to be fully agile we also need to "virtualise" the workforce. Then we could have a flexible workforce using flexible computing...
